<p>These are the observations of the warrior monk Itzairo Taran-Da-Chi, of the CTM-Ryu school, musing about the experiences and people along the road to Reasonable Security. </p>

<ul>
<li>The man who threat models his friends' systems will collect the bounty. But the man who threat models his own systems will sleep the whole night. &#128591;</li>

<li>Life is navigating your own threat model and only appearing on other people's as a mitigation to threats. &#128506;&#65039;</li>

<li>What is the color of what you're building? &#127912; What is the taste of what could go wrong? &#128523; What sounds does what you can do about it makes? &#127926; A threat model fulfills every sense.</li>

<li>You did good if you did well.</li>

<li>Before threat modeling, chop wood &#129683;, carry water &#127754;. After threat modeling, chop wood, carry water.</li>

<li>If a threat turns into a vulnerability but there was no impact, was it a threat?</li>

<li>What sound does a no-alert design make? &#9888;&#65039;</li>

<li>A threat model of a thousand systems begins with a single question. &#10067;</li>

<li>The threat model pointing at the flaw is not the flaw.</li>

<li>Threat model rather than be threatened by a model.</li>

<li>When the mind becomes still, the design sings &#129489;&#8205;&#127908; and the flaws cough. &#128567;</li>

<li>A life well threat modeled is a life well lived. &#127881;</li>

<li>You can ask a LLM, but it can't answer. &#129302;</li>
</ul>
